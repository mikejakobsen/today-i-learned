Todo: Vim gist workflow

[Gists](https://gist.github.com/) are an easy way to work with small bits of code without creating a fully fledged repository.

Add `.pibb` to the end of any Gist URL ([like this](https://gist.github.com/tiimgreen/10545817.pibb)) in order to get the *HTML only* version suitable for embedding in any other site.

Gists can be treated as a repository so they can be cloned like any other:

```bash
$ git clone https://gist.github.com/tiimgreen/10545817
```

This means you also can modify and push updates to Gists:

```bash
$ git commit
$ git push
Username for 'https://gist.github.com':
Password for 'https://tiimgreen@gist.github.com':
```

However, Gists do not support directories. All files need to be added to the repository root.

### Git.io
[Git.io](http://git.io) is a simple URL shortener for GitHub.

You can also use it via pure HTTP using Curl:

```bash
$ curl -i http://git.io -F "url=https://github.com/..."
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://git.io/abc123

$ curl -i http://git.io/abc123
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://github.com/...
```
