I recently stumbled upon a Git repository with a bunch of cryptic, but yet descriptive emojis. 



Every commit, had like a Emoji suffix. For instance..

The 🎨 `art emoji` of cause meant improving the structure / formatting of the code.
The `pencil`  ✏️ odiously ment fixing typos.
And the turd, meant `Writing bad code that needs to be improved.` 💩

It might not be a good practice everywhere. But i kindda like it. 

There's even a NPM based command-line helper to help you memorize the emojis, and use them.

To use gitmojis from your command line install [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli). A gitmoji interactive client for using emojis on commit messages.

```
npm i -g gitmoji-cli
```

Here's a complete list:
