I do quite a lot frontend work. So i spend a lot of time exporting all kind of image assets in Photoshop or Sketch.
In the newest version they both included a new way to export image assets, but they somehow forgot about the
favicon?

To create `favicon.ico`, you don't need anything other than ImageMagick.

    brew install imagemagick

Use it to convert PNG's into .ico: (use 32px and 16px sizes for retina compatibility)

    convert favicon-32.png favicon-16.png favicon.ico

You can even use it to generate a 16px version from a 32px:

    convert favicon-32.png -resize 16x16 favicon16.png
