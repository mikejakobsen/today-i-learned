There are a number of programs out there that allow you to view a web page
from right within the terminal. These text-based browsers are great for
viewing pages that make basic use of html without relying on JavaScript for
fancy user interactions, such as the docs page for a language.

One such program is `link`. If you don't already have it, you can install it
with something like `homebrew`. Then run `links` with any URL for a
magnificent, ad-free experience:

```
links http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-string.html
```
