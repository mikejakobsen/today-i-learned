The `say` command can be a fun party trick.

```bash
$ say Get ready for the bass to drop
```

Your friends will be even more impressed when you use some of the alternate
voices.

```bash
$ say -v Daniel "Would you like a cup of tea?"
```

To see all the alternate voices available, type the following

```bash
$ say -v '?'
```
