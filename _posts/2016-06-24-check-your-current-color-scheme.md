Vim ships with a number of different color schemes. There is also a plethora
of color schemes built by the open source community. If you'd like to know
what color scheme you are currently using, you can check with

```
:echo g:colors_name
```

So more details at both `:h g:colors_name` and `:h colorscheme`.
